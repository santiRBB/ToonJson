# JSON ⟷ TOON

This repo contains two things:

- A [**web playground**](https://toonjson.netlify.app/) to convert between JSON and [TOON](https://github.com/toon-format/toon) in the browser.
- A **Python package** (`toonjson`) to do the same conversions in your code.

TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) is a data format designed to be more token-efficient than JSON when talking to LLMs, especially for tabular data.
